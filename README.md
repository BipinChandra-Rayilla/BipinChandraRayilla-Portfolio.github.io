# Projects Created, Contributed & Value Add
## Data Analysis & Visualizations
### 1. Descriptive Analysis and Statistic - [source code](https://github.com/BipinChandra-Rayilla/Descriptive-Analysis-Statistics)
### The health care and government departments can look into the below data and consider the importance to provide necessities by prioritising based on volume.

## 2. COVID-19 Vaccination Progress
### This visualization focuses on AstraZeneca and further details on how major countries can improvies. [dataset](https://github.com/BipinChandra-Rayilla/Data-Visualization-Covid-19-/edit/main/README.md)

## 3. Battery Electric Vehicles Rating (2012-2021) - [source code](https://github.com/BipinChandra-Rayilla/Battery-Electric-Vehicles-Rating)
### Analysis 
### This will help business to analyse on the performance of vehciles and also forecast how electric vehicles can be revolutionary in future.
- All the vehicles listed here are electric/battery based. (2012-2021)
- These chart determines the make, model and yearly surge of launching the vehicles.
- Each vehicle has a different performance when it drove in a city and when it is on a highway
- - This dataset indicates all the vehicles are emitting 0% carbon dioxide, since each vehicle model fuel by electric/battery
- Running a performance check based on number of kms – if the vehicle is ranging between 0-250 kms then its indicated as Good and the ones above 250-500 are Top Range

## 4. Cancer Data (Python) - [source code](https://github.com/BipinChandra-Rayilla/CancerData-Modelling)
### Identifications Reported: Both LR and LDA reports were matching.
### Logical Regression
- Based on the dataset it is clear that it’s a binomial classification where the response variable is dichotomous (1 or 0).
- The recall range is above 90% range which indicates a good learning curve.
- Class split is clearly identifying the imbalance, which is also observed in support values for each category.
- AUC (Area Under Curve) is 0.98 ~ (approx. 1)
- The trade-off between sensitivity i.e., True Positive Rate and False Positivity Rate is quite perfect.

### Discriminant Analysis
- As per EDA using Pandas Profile Report it was clear that the class was imbalanced and before modeling LDA balancing the data sample was required using SMOTE.
- AUC (Area Under Curve) is 0.97 ~ (approx. 1)
- The trade-off between sensitivity i.e., True Positive Rate and False Positivity Rate is quite perfect.
